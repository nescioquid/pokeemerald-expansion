/*
Trainers and their parties defined with Competetive Syntax.
Compatible with Pokemon Showdown exports.
https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/TEAMS.md

A trainer specification starts with "=== TRAINER_XXXX ==="
and includes everything until the next line that starts with "==="
or the file ends.
A blank line is required between the trainer and their Pokemon
and between their Pokemon.
TRAINER_XXXX is how the trainer is referred to within code.

Fields with description and/or example of usage
Required fields for trainers:
    - Name
    - Pic
Optional (but still recommended) fields for trainers:
    - Class (if not specified, PkMn Trainer will be used)
    - Gender (Male/Female, affects random gender weights of party if not specified)
    - Music
    - Items (Some Item / Another Item / Third Item)
            (Can also be specified with ITEM_SOME_ITEM)
    - Battle Type (Singles / Doubles, defaults to Singles)
    - AI (AI Flag / Another Flag / Third Flag / ...
          see include/constants/battle_ai.h for all flags)
    - Mugshot (enable Mugshots during battle transition
               set to one of Purple, Green, Pink, Blue or Yellow)
    - Starting Status (see include/constants/battle.h for values)

Pokemon are then specified using the Showdown Export format.
If a field is not specified, it will use its default value.

Required fields for Pokemon:
    - Species (Either as SPECIES_ABRA or Abra)
      This line also specifies Gender, Nickname and Held item.
      Alfred (Abra) (M) @ Eviolite
      Roberta (SPECIES_ABRA) (F) @ ITEM_CHOICE_SPECS
      Both lines are valid. Gender (M) or (F) must use a capital letter.
      Nickname length is limited to 10 characters using standard letters.
      With narrow font it's increased to 12. Longer strings will be silently shortened.

Optional fields for Pokemon:
    - Level (Number between 1 and 100, defaults to 100)
    - Ability (Ability Name or ABILITY_ABILITY_NAME)
    - IVs (0 HP / 1 Atk / 2 Def / 3 SpA / 4 SpD / 5 Spe, defaults to all 31)
          (Order does not matter)
    - EVs (252 HP / 128 Spe / 48 Def, defaults to all 0, is not capped at 512 total)
          (Order does not matter)
    - Ball (Poke Ball or ITEM_POKE_BALL, defaults to Poke Ball)
    - Happiness (Number between 1 and 255)
    - Nature (Rash or NATURE_RASH, defaults to Hardy)
    - Shiny (Yes/No, defaults to No)
    - Dynamax Level (Number between 0 and 10, default 10, also sets "shouldDynamax" to True)
    - Gigantamax (Yes/No, sets to Gigantamax factor)
                 (doesn't do anything to Pokemon without a Gigantamax form, also sets "shouldDynamax" to True)
    - Tera Type (Set to a Type, either Fire or TYPE_FIRE, also sets "shouldTerastal" to True)
Moves are defined with a - (dash) followed by a single space, then the move name.
Either "- Tackle" or "- MOVE_TACKLE" works. One move per line.
Moves have to be the last lines of a Pokemon.
If no moves are specified, the Pokemon will use the last 4 moves it learns
through levelup at its level.

Default IVs and Level can be changed in the "main" function of tools/trainerproc/main.c
